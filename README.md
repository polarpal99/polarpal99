- 👋 Hi, I’m @polarpal99
- 👀 I’m interested in #TechForGood, the effort to improve life and the quality of life through conscientiously applied technology. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some DevOps technologies I need for a better job. What I know is great, but I need more. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects after I land a new job. In the past, I have worked open source projects for storm chasing and additive technologies. 
- 📫 How to reach me email: polarpal99@ameritech.net. I typically respond within 24 hours.
